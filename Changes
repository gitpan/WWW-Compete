	- updated tests to deal with problem of requiring API key but
          running under automated smoketesting.  It is recommended that you 
          confirm the installation by editing and then running 
          examples/simple_fetch.pl. The editing amounts to adding your API
          key.

        - Noted some module dependencies in Makefile.PL, to (hopefully) 
          get around some automated testing issues.  Module is otherwise 
          unchanged.
